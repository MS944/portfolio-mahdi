# Questions:

    Q1-Describe key events in the development of the internet from the 1980s to today.

    A-   
•	-Packet switching: sending of small pieces of information from an origin to a destination, which came to be a foundation for the internet as we know it.
•	-ARPAnet: designing Arpanet using using packet switching technology to interconnect computers around the nation.
•	TCP/IP: Transmission Control Protocol and Internet Protocol (TCP/IP) technology, which together became known as the Internet Protocol Suite.The TCP element handles the reliability of the data sent from one IP address to another.
•	Email: connecting an individual user name and a domain name with an @ symbol to send personal communications to individual internet users.
•	Domain name system was another key event.
•	The World Wide Web: created Hyper Text Markup Language (HTML)
•	First proper web browser is another step of development of web.

    Q2-Define and describes the relationship between fundamental aspects of the internet such as: domains, web servers, DNS, and web browsers.

    A-
•	Computers connected to the web are called clients and servers. Clients are the typical web user's internet-connected devices (for example, your computer connected to your Wi-Fi, or your phone connected to your mobile network) and web-accessing software available on those devices (usually a web browser like Firefox or Chrome).
•	Servers are computers that store webpages, sites, or apps. When a client device wants to access a webpage, a copy of the webpage is downloaded from the server onto the client machine to be displayed in the user's web browser.
When we type a web address into our browser ,The browser goes to the DNS server(Domain Name Servers), and finds the real address of the server that the website lives on .
•	The browser sends an HTTP request message to the server, asking it to send a copy of the website to the client. This message, and all other data sent between the client and the server, is sent across your internet connection using TCP/IP(Transmission Control Protocol and Internet Protocol ).
•	If the server approves the client's request, the server sends the client a O" message, and then starts sending the website's files to the browser as a series of small chunks called data packets.
•	The browser assembles the small chunks into a complete website and displays it to user.
 
    Q3-Reflect on one aspect of the development of internet technologies and how it has contributed to the world today.

    A-
    The Internet and Education
The Internet has clearly impacted all levels of education by providing unbounded possibilities for learning. I believe the future of education is a networked future. People can use the Internet to create and share knowledge and develop new ways of teaching and learning that captivate and stimulate students’ imagination at any time, anywhere, using any device. By connecting and empowering students and educators, we can speed up economic growth and enhance the well-being of society throughout the world. We should work together, over a network, to build the global learning society.
